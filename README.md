# FriendFinder 
Challenge project 5 in my 100 days of SwiftUI- Hacking with Swift journey. This project was the next one to build with no help from tutorials. FriendFinder displays users (taken from the example URL) in a list. 
Each person has their own detail screen, displaying an image, their age, company, more info about them, a list of their interests in a horizontal scroll view and a list of their friends in a horizontal scroll view.
The app should only make the network request once, then for further uses, retrieve data from SwiftData. If this fails, it will fall back to the network request.
# Features
- Inspecting json data and creating appropriate data models.
- Creating a reusable, customisable tag card view.
- Practicing network requests.
- Building attractive and functional UI.
- Decoding and formatting dates from json.
- Further practice with SwiftData.
